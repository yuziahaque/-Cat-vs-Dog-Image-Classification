# -Cat-vs-Dog-Image-Classification
This repository focuses on building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for classifying images into either cats or dogs. Leveraging the power of deep learning, the model is trained on a dataset containing labeled images of cats and dogs, allowing it to learn intricate features for accurate classification.
